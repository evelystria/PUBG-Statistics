# PUBG-Statistics
> An unofficial, non-affiliated application to check player's statistics

## About
Another project I've started to do for fun during my free time. I want to develop a desktop application for myself to track my own
as well as other players' statistics, and generate a textfile for the stats.

* Application will not be designed to suit for public use, but personal
* Source codes will be released here once the app has been developed

Thanks to https://pubgtracker.com/ for the API, to make this ideation possible :)
